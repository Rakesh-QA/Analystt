I wanted to express my appreciation for the opportunity to participate in your internship application process. As requested, I have completed the assignment that involved developing an automated test script for a sample web application.

However, I must inform you that I have implemented the solution in Java rather than Python, as my expertise lies in Java programming. I wanted to ensure that I delivered the most accurate and efficient solution for your evaluation.

The Java-based automation script accomplishes the same task as the Python-based script, automating the login process for the sample web application. It includes comments to explain each step of the automation process, as per your instructions.

I understand that Python may be the preferred language for this role, but I wanted to demonstrate my commitment to the internship opportunity by providing a solution that showcases my skills in a language I am proficient in. I am more than willing to adapt to Python if necessary and am confident in my ability to do so quickly.

If you would like to review my Java-based solution, please let me know how you would prefer to receive the code or any other specific requirements you may have. I am open to any feedback or further instructions.

Thank you once again for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my assignment and my potential contribution to your team further.
